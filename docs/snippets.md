# sasjs snippets
The `sasjs snippets` command generates VS Code snippets from project Macros mentioned in `sasjs/sasjsconfig.json` file as `"macroFolders": ["macros"]`. If `macroFolders` are defined at configuration and target level, both arrays will be merged in the single array of macro folders. `sasjs snippets` command will be using all `.sas` files from provided `macroFolders` including sub folders.

## Syntax
```
sasjs snippets --outDirectory <folderPath> --target <targetName>
```
- `--outDirectory` (alias `-o`) - optional output directory. If not present, generated snippets will be saved to `sasjsresults/sasjs-macro-snippets.json` file.
- `--target` (alias `-t`) - optional target that should be used.

## Example of the macro that is used to generate VS Code snippet

File name `example.sas`.
```
/**
  @file
  @brief An example macro
  @details prints an arbitrary message to the log

  @param msg The message to be printed
  @author Allan Bowe

**/

%macro example(msg);

  %let testvar=%sysfunc(ranuni(0));

  data work.example;
    msg=symget('msg');
    putlog msg=;
  run;

%mend example ;
```

## Example of the VS Code snippet generated by `sasjs command` from the macro provided above

```
{
  "example": {
    "prefix": "%example",
    "body": "%example($1)",
    "description": [
      "An example macro",
      "\r",
      "Params:\r",
      "-msg The message to be printed\r"
    ]
  }
}
```

Notice that `@brief` has been placed at the beginning of description and `@param` has been put to the list of `Params` of the description section. File name has been used in `prefix` and `body` of the VS Code snippet.

## Import generated VS Code snippets to your VS Code

1. Open Command Pallet by pressing `F1` (unix) or `ctrl+shift+P` (windows).
2. Type `Snippets: Configure User Snippets`.
3. Choose `sas.json`.
4. Copy everything from the file generated by `sasjs snippets` command and paste it into `sas.json`.
