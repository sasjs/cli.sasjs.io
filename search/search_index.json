If Local is chosen, the target configuration will be added in the /sasjs/sasjsconfig.json file, and any credentials (eg tokens) will be saved in the .sasjsrc file in the current SASjs project directory. The sasjs command will use this config whenever running inside the SASjs project. If Global is chosen, the target configuration will be added to a .sasjsrc file in the users home directory. The sasjs command will look for a target here if executed outside of a SASjs project. Server Type \u00b6 The second prompt requests a server type. Choose 1 for SAS Viya, or 2 for SAS 9. Target Name \u00b6 Choose a name for your target. Nearly every SASjs command will take this as input, so you might want to keep it short. Target Server URL \u00b6 This is the protocol / servername / port of your target, for instance: https://sas.analytium:8080 SAS Viya Specific \u00b6 If SAS Viya was chosen as the server type you will be prompted for a Viya Client ID and secret - this is used for connecting to the SAS Viya REST APIs. To autogenerate these you can also check out the Viya Token Generator . Once you have entered the client and secret, you will be given a link - click this to generate the authorisation code (one time step). The token will eventually expire - the majority of commands will show the link again at this point to refresh the token. To avoid this happening in batch, be sure your token remains valid, eg by setting a longer expiry period.

Be sure to use a secure mechanism such as the %inc approach described above, or another approved mechanism for securing these kinds of variables. Deploy \u00b6 The build program generated in the previous step can be deployed in 3 ways: 1 - MANUAL: copy paste the code into SAS Studio or Enterprise Guide and run it 2 - SSH: build a shell script or bat file to load, and execute with a web service 3 - API: Use the SAS APIs Points 2 and 3 can be configured / executed with a single sasjs deploy or sasjs d command. You can compile, build AND deploy using sasjs cbd [target] . If you don't specify a target (eg sas9 or viya) then the first target in the sasjsconfig.json file is used. CopyPaste approach \u00b6 The build script (named as per buildOutputFileName ) can be copy pasted into SAS Studio and executed to create the backend services. Please note: You will be running under your own identity. If you need files created under the Web Server identity, deploy your build script using a web service. For Viya, you must use SASStudioV (or ensure the client/secret/access_token are provided) SSH approach \u00b6 You can SSH (rsync or scp) your build script onto the SAS Server then %inc it from a web service - the web service could be created using the code below: filename mc url \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sasjs/core/main/all.sas\" ; %inc mc; filename ft15f001 temp; parmcards4; %inc \"/path/to/your/sasjsdeploy.sas\" /source2; ;;;; %mp_createwebservice (name=Executor, code=ft15f001 , replace =YES) This creates the service in your HOME directory (SAS 9 or Viya). You can now create a local script (eg mysas9deploy.sh ) and add it to the tgtDeployScripts array (the root is always the sasjs folder). echo \"sasjs: uploading frontend\" rsync -avz /home/me/myapp/dist/* me@sasserver:/var/www/html/myapp echo \"sasjs: uploading deploy program\" scp sasjsbuild/mysas9deploy.sas me@sasserver:/tmp/mysas9deploy.sas echo \"sasjs: running Executor\" curl -v -L -k -b cookiefile -c cookiefile \" $URL & $CREDS \" API Approach \u00b6 Any files in your tgtDeployScripts array that have a \".sas\" extension will be sent to the relevant API (9 or Viya) for execution. Viya API deployment \u00b6 The Viya deploy requires 3 things: access_token serverUrl contextName In order of priority, the access_token is taken from the following locations: tgtDeployVars tgtBuildVars the .env file. This is the preferred / recommended location! The serverUrl is the location of your Viya server. The contextName is the execution service on which your SAS code will execute. You can get a list of available contexts by running a GET to the following endpoint: /compute/contexts SAS 9 \u00b6 For SAS 9 deployment we integrate with SAS9API by Analytium ( https://sas9api.io ), you can contact them for a free trial copy. Configuration as follows: \"tgtDeployVars\" : { \"serverName\" : \"SASApp\" , \"repositoryName\" : \"Foundation\" } , \"serverUrl\" : \"https://SASSERVER:PORT\" , Demo \u00b6 A 2 minute video demonstrating how an app can be built and a deployment script created is shown below.","title":"sasjs create"},{"location":"create/#sasjs-create","text":"To create a new project, run: sasjs create mynewproject To install in an existing project, change into that directory and run: sasjs create (without arguments).
