Please note - this repository contains the _documentation_ for the SASjs CLI  at https://cli.sasjs.io

If you are raising an issue for the CLI itself, you should use this link:  https://github.com/sasjs/cli/issues

If you are suggesting a minor change to the docs (eg typo fixes etc) there is no need to raise an issue.  Just make a pull request!  And, thanks for your contribution.

The documentation site is automatically rebuilt after every merge.
